# Representation Engineering / Control Vectors / Steering Vectors

## What is it?

Representation Engineering refers to the practice of refining and optimizing the internal representations within an AI model, particularly in neural networks, to make the model's decision-making process more interpretable and transparent. By understanding and adjusting how features are represented within the model, engineers can better align the AI's outputs with human-understandable concepts, thus enhancing the model's transparency.

Control Vectors are specific vectors within the latent space of a neural network that can be adjusted to influence the modelâ€™s output in a predictable manner. These vectors act as levers to control certain aspects of the model's behavior, making it possible to steer the model towards or away from certain outcomes while maintaining transparency in how those outcomes are reached.

Steering Vectors are similar to control vectors but are typically used to guide the model towards desired behaviors or outputs by nudging the model in a particular direction within the latent space. Steering vectors enable fine-tuning of the model's responses, helping to ensure that the model behaves in a manner consistent with human values or specific objectives, further contributing to the transparency and reliability of AI systems.
